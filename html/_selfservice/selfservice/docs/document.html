<h2><span class="mw-headline">Supportworks ITSM SelfService User Guide</span></h2>
</div><div id="1.1" class="level2 section">
<h3><span class="mw-headline">What is SelfService?</span></h3>
<p><b>SelfService</b> is a Web-based application, which allow you to access your organisation's IT support and IT services, at any time of the day.</p>
<p>To access SelfService, logon via web browser either on the desktop or on a mobile device, using the address provided by your systems administrator.</p>
</div><div id="1.1.1" class="level3 section">
<h4><span class="mw-headline">SelfService functions</span></h4>
<p>You can use SelfService to request IT support ("raising Support Requests"). For example, you can report a problem you are having with your email access.</p>
<p>You can also use SelfService to request a particular set of IT services ("Raising Service Requests"). For example, you can request a set of IT services for a new employee at your organisation.</p>
<p>Other SelfService functions include:</p>
<ul><li>Accessing public announcements on service availability</li>
<li>Track the status of your requests, and receive updates on open requests</li>
<li>Send feedback on requests to your organisation's Service Desk</li>
<li>Search your organisation's Knowledgebase for an answer to your query or problem.</li>
</ul><p>These functions are described within this Guide.</p>
</div><div id="1.1.2" class="level3 section">
<h4><span class="mw-headline">SelfService for Management and Business owners</span></h4>
<p>In addition to the standard functions outlined above, SelfService functionality also allow managers to view requests raised by their team members, and authorise those requests if required.</p>
<p>Service Business Owners can also view business details for Services they own.</p>
</div><div id="1.1.3" class="level3 section">
<h4><span class="mw-headline">SelfService Benefits</span></h4>
<p>Having a single location to create and monitor your contacts with your organisation's IT Service Desk makes it much easier for you to organise and track such contact; this avoids the need for you to keep track of emails or telephone calls.</p>
<p>All contacts (requests) are handled consistently, and are stored in a single location - so you always know where to look, to find out what is happening for a particular request you made.</p>
</div><div id="1.2" class="level2 section">
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Launching SelfService</span></h3>
<p>To access SelfService:</p>
<ol><li>Open your browser, and enter the correct URL (supplied by your systems administrator).</li>
<li>Enter a customer's ID and password when prompted.
<dl><dd>For example:</dd>
<dd><img src="images/image-001.png" alt="[image-001.png]"/></dd>
</dl></li>
<li>The Home page will then be displayed.</li>
</ol><p>Once customers have logged in, they can view / raise requests, update existing requests, and search the KnowledgeBase.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> SelfService functions and displays can all be configured by your systems administrator, to meet your organisation's requirements.</p>
</div><div id="1.3" class="level2 section">
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Home page</span></h3>
<p>The Home page provides an overview of current request information, plus navigation and other functions.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><img src="images/image-002.png" alt="[image-002.png]"/></p>
<p>This shows:</p>
<ul><li><b>Navigation options:</b> these allow you to navigate through the SelfService system. Specific options are described in other sections of this Guide.</li>
<li>A combined <b>Search</b> area is provided at the top of the screen which will gather results from Services, Requests and the Knowledgebase.</li>
<li><b>Information Board:</b> a welcome message as defined by the Service Desk team.</li>
<li><b>Recently Updated Requests:</b> a summary of your requests with recent call activity.</li>
<li><b>Favourite Services</b> you can select Services which you would like to appear in this list.</li>
<li><b>Notifications:</b> Any relevant notifications of your Service and CI availability and notifications of any pending authorisations for you to action. The Service Desk can also provide general updates through this feature.</li>
</ul></div><div id="1.4" class="level2 section">
<h3><span class="mw-headline">My Services</span></h3>
<p>The <b>My Services</b> page displays your services (subscribed and unsubscribed), along with a <b>Service Details</b> display and a list of <b>Active</b> and <b>Closed Requests</b> for the Service. There are also search and filtering options to help you find specific Services.</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<li><b>Services I own:</b> (For Business Owners) this lists all the Services available to that organisation, including all Services available in the Service Portfolio (not just those available in the Service Catalog). In addition, this allows you to view business-specific details about specific services.</li>
